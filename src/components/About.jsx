        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I’m Sam — a junior software developer based in Seattle with a background in healthcare and a passion for human-centered digital experiences. 
          After four years as a dental assistant, I made the leap into tech through General Assembly’s Software Engineering Bootcamp where I built full-stack apps using React, Node, Python, and MongoDB.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          My past in healthcare taught me empathy, attention to detail, and how to stay calm under pressure — all of which I bring into my development work.
          I love projects that mix logic, creativity, and impact — whether it’s a plant-sharing platform, a translation tool, or a journaling app for travel memories.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I’m currently open to junior developer roles (remote or Seattle-based) and I’m especially excited about opportunities in health tech, green tech, and mission-driven organizations.
